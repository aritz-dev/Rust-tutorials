        SCALAR TYPES: A scalar type represents a single value

        INTEGER
        Each signed variant can store numbers from −(2n − 1) to 2n − 1 − 1 inclusive, 
        where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from −(27) to 27 − 1, 
        which equals −128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n − 1, 
        so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 − 1, which equals 0 to 255.

        i8=                        -128 / 127
        u8=                           0 / 255
        i16=                    -32,768 / 32,767
        u16=                          0 / 65,535
        i32=             -2,147,483,648 / 2,147,483,647
        u32=                          0 / 4,294,967,295
        i64= -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 / 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
        u64=                          0 / 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
